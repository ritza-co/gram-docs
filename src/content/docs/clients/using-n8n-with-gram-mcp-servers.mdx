[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a powerful workflow automation tool that lets you build complex automations with a visual node-based interface. It's open-source, self-hostable, and supports hundreds of integrations out of the box.

When combined with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, n8n can leverage AI agents that have access to your tools and infrastructure, enabling intelligent automation workflows that can interact with your APIs, databases, and other services.

This guide will show you how to connect n8n to a [Gram-hosted MCP server](/blog/the-easiest-way-to-host-mcp-servers) using Taskmaster, a full-stack CRUD application for task and project management. Taskmaster includes a web UI for managing projects and tasks, a built-in HTTP API, OAuth 2.0 authentication, and a Neon PostgreSQL database for storing data. You can try the [demo app](https://taskmaster-speakeasyapi.vercel.app/) to see it in action.

You'll learn how to set up the connection, test it, and use natural language to manage tasks, projects, and workflows in automated workflows.

Find the full code and OpenAPI document in the [Taskmaster repository](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/taskmaster).

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A [Gram account](https://getgram.ai).
- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) installed and running (either self-hosted or cloud).
- An API key from an LLM provider supported by n8n (such as Anthropic or OpenAI).

## Creating an MCP server

Before connecting n8n to a Taskmaster MCP server, you'll need to create one first. Follow the [Creating a Taskmaster MCP server](/build-mcp/creating-taskmaster-mcp-server) guide to set up your server.

## Connecting n8n to your Gram-hosted MCP server

Now we'll create an n8n workflow that connects to your Taskmaster MCP server.

### Creating a basic workflow

Create a new workflow in n8n. We'll build a simple chat workflow that can interact with the Taskmaster API.

1. Add a **Chat Trigger** node to start the workflow:
   * Click the **+** button
   * Search for "Chat Trigger"
   * Click anywhere outside the canvas or hit Esc to add the node with default settings

2. Add an **AI Agent** node:
   * Click the **+** button after the Chat Trigger
   * Search for "AI Agent" 
   * Click anywhere outside the canvas or hit Esc to add the node with default settings

After adding the AI Agent node, you need to configure two things: a chat model and a tool.

### Configuring the chat model

For the chat model, you can use any AI provider you prefer. In this demo, we're using OpenAI:

1. Click on the AI Agent node to open its configuration
2. In the **Model** section, select your preferred chat model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4)
3. Add your API key for the chosen provider

### Adding MCP Client Tool

Now add the tool to connect to the Gram MCP server:

1. In the **Tools** section, click **Add Tool**
2. Search for "MCP Client" and select it

3. Configure the MCP Client with your Taskmaster server details:
   * Add your public URL from the Taskmaster MCP config: `https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/your-taskmaster-slug`
   * Change the connection type to **HTTP Streamable**
   * Replace `your-taskmaster-slug` with the actual slug from your Taskmaster MCP server configuration

### Testing the workflow

Now you should have two connected nodes in your workflow. To test it:

1. Click **Open Chat** in the bottom panel
2. Ask a question like "Can you create a new task called 'Test workflow automation'?"
3. The AI agent will use the MCP server to create a task and provide a response

## Troubleshooting

Let's go through some common issues and how to fix them.

### MCP Client not connecting

If the MCP Client can't connect to your server:

- Verify the server URL is correct
- Check that the MCP server is published as public in Gram
- For authenticated servers, ensure your API key is valid
- Test the connection using the Gram Playground first

### Tool calls not working

If the AI agent isn't calling the MCP tools:

- Ensure the MCP Client is properly configured in the AI Agent node
- Check that your AI model has sufficient context about available tools
- Try being more explicit in your prompts about using the Taskmaster tools

### Authentication errors

For authenticated servers:

- Verify your Gram API key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**
- Ensure the authorization header format is correct
- Check that environment variables are correctly set in Gram

## What's next

You now have n8n connected to a Gram-hosted MCP server, enabling AI-powered automation workflows with access to your APIs and tools.
