[ChatGPT's](https://chatgpt.com/) new Developer Mode lets you wire external capabilities into ChatGPT via custom connectors.

:::note[Developer Mode]
Developer Mode is currently only available to Plus and Pro plans. It is not available to Free or Business plans. You can [read more about Developer Mode in OpenAI's docs here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode).
:::

When combined with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers hosted on [Gram](/gram-quickstart), you can give ChatGPT access to your APIs and tools in just a few minutes.

This guide will walk you through connecting ChatGPT to a [Gram-hosted MCP server](/blog/the-easiest-way-to-host-mcp-servers) using the example Acme Todo API. You'll learn how to set up the connection, configure the custom connector, and test it with natural language prompts to manage your todos.

We'll use the Acme Todo API as our example; it's a simple Python Flask REST API for managing todo items. You can find the complete OpenAPI specification here: [`acmetodo.yaml`](https://github.com/ritza-co/acme-todo/blob/main/acmetodo.yaml).

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A [Gram account](https://app.getgram.ai).
- A ChatGPT account with access to Developer Mode (Plus or Pro).
- A deployed version of the Acme Todo API. You can fork our [Acme Todo API repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/acme-todo) and deploy it to your own infrastructure.

## Creating a Gram MCP server

If you already have a Gram-hosted MCP server configured, you can skip to [connecting ChatGPT to your Gram-hosted MCP server](#connecting-chatgpt-to-your-gram-hosted-mcp-server). For an in-depth guide to how Gram works and more details on creating a Gram-hosted MCP server, check out the [Gram concepts guide](/blog/gram-concepts).

### Setting up a Gram project

In the [Gram dashboard](https://app.getgram.ai), click **New Project** to start the guided setup flow for creating a toolset and MCP server.

Enter a project name and click **Submit**.

![Screenshot of the Gram dashboard showing the New Project link](/img/guides/chatgpt/create-new-project.png)

Click **Get Stared** on the project home page. Gram will then guide you through the following steps.

#### Step 1: Upload the OpenAPI document

Upload the Acme Todo OpenAPI document [`acmetodo.yaml`](https://github.com/ritza-co/acme-todo/blob/main/acmetodo.yaml), enter the name of your API, and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the upload your OpenAPI spec dialog](/img/guides/chatgpt/uploading-openapi.png)

#### Step 2: Create a toolset

Give your toolset a name (for example, "Acmetodo") and click **Continue**.

Notice that the names of the tools that will be generated from your OpenAPI document are displayed in this dialog.

![Screenshot of the create toolset dialog](/img/guides/chatgpt/create-toolset.png)

#### Step 3: Configure MCP

Enter a URL slug for the MCP server (for example, `acme-todo`) and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the configure MCP dialog](/img/guides/chatgpt/configure-mcp-slug.png)

Gram will create the toolset from the OpenAPI document.

Click **Toolsets** in the sidebar to view the Acmetodo toolset.

You can edit the individual tools in the toolset by clicking on the tool name and the tool description.

![Screenshot of the MCP details page](/img/guides/chatgpt/mcp-details.png)

### Configuring environment variables

:::note[Server URL]
By default, the server URL is set by the OpenAPI document. The `acmetodo` openapi document uses a base URL of `https://api.ritzademo.com` which points to our live demo acmetodo API.

If you are using your own API, you will need to set the server URL to the URL of your deployment. You can either edit the OpenAPI document and skip the step below, or set the server URL in the environment variables.
:::

[Environments](/concepts/environments) store API keys and configuration separate from your toolset logic.

In the **Environments** tab, click the "Default" environment. Click the three dots in the top right corner of the environment card and then **Fill for Toolset**. Select the **Acmetodo** toolset and click **Fill Variables** to automatically populate the required variables.

![Screenshot showing the fill for toolset dialog to automatically populate required variables](/img/guides/chatgpt/env-fill-vars.png)

Set the base URL variable for your API. For example, if your Acmetodo API is deployed at `https://acme-todo.example.com`, set `ACMETODO_SERVER_URL` to that value. Click **Save**.

![Screenshot showing setting the server URL environment variable](/img/guides/chatgpt/add-server-url.png)

### Publishing an MCP server

Let's make the toolset available as an MCP server.

Go to the **MCP** tab, find the Acmetodo toolset and click on it to open the MCP details page.

Enable the MCP server by clicking the **Enable** button and then **Enable Server**.

![Screenshot showing the enable button to enable the MCP server](/img/guides/chatgpt/enable-mcp.png)

Scroll down to the **Visibility** section and ensure the visibility of the server is set to **Public**.

![Screenshot showing server visibility](/img/guides/chatgpt/server-visibility.png)

Scroll down to the **Hosted URL** section and copy the URL.

## Connecting ChatGPT to your Gram-hosted MCP server

ChatGPT supports MCP servers as connectors in Developer Mode. Here's how to add an MCP server connector to ChatGPT.

### Add a Remote MCP server connector in ChatGPT

1. In Gram, go to the **MCP** tab for your toolset, and copy the **Hosted URL**.
2. In ChatGPT web, open settings, go to the **Connectors** tab and scroll down to **Advanced settings**. Click the **Enable Developer Mode** switch.

   ![Enable Developer Mode](/img/guides/chatgpt/enable-developer-mode.png)

3. Go back to the **Connectors** tab and click the **Create** button.

   ![Open Connectors and add a new Remote MCP](/img/guides/chatgpt/connectors-create-button.png)

4. Fill in the details as shown in the dialog:
   - **Name**: `Acmetodo`
   - **Description**: The description of the connector.
   - **Server URL**: Paste your Gram Hosted URL
   - **Authentication**: Here you can choose to use OAuth for authentication. The acme todo MCP server doesn't require authentication so we'll choose **No authentication**.

    ![Add Remote MCP server connector dialog](/img/guides/chatgpt/add-remote-mcp.png)

    Finally click the checkbox for **I trust this application**.

5. Click **Create**.


Once saved, the MCP server appears as a connector in the **Connectors** section.

![Remote MCP tool installed](/img/guides/chatgpt/acme-todo-installed-chatgpt.png)

You'll see tools listed as **Actions**. You can also enable or disable individual tools.

### Using the connector in a chat

Start a new chat in ChatGPT, click the **+** icon to open the dropdown and select **Developer Mode** under **More**.

![Enable Developer Mode for the chat](/img/guides/chatgpt/enable-developer-mode-chat.png)

Enable the Acmetodo connector.

![Enable the Acme MCP tool in chat](/img/guides/chatgpt/enable-acme-mcp.png)

Ask something that requires the Acme Todo API, for example:

```
Create a new task, I need to go for a hike this Saturday. Use acme todo.
```

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="/videos/chatgpt-acme-todo-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Troubleshooting

- **Connector not connecting**: Verify the MCP server URL in the tool matches the one in Gram. You can test the MCP server first in the **Gram Playground**.

![Screenshot showing how to test an MCP server in the Gram Playground](/img/guides/chatgpt/playground-test.png)
- **Authentication errors**: For private servers, confirm your Gram API key in **Settings -> API Keys** and ensure the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header is configured in ChatGPT.
- **Tools not appearing**: Confirm your toolset includes the expected tools and the environment variables are set. Re-publish the server if you updated the toolset.

## What's next

You now have ChatGPT connected to a Gram-hosted MCP server built from the Acme Todo API. Ready to build your own? [Try Gram today](https://getgram.ai) and turn any OpenAPI into agent-ready tools your models can use safely.
