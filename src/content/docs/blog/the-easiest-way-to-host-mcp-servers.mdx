If you offer an API, you've probably been focused on trying to make it as good as possible for humans. Now you also need to make it easy to use for AI Agents. 

At [Speakeasy](https://speakeasy.com), we've generated over 50 production-ready MCP servers for our customers, and we've seen first-hand the complexity of creating, deploying, and hosting an MCP server for your API. We built [Gram](https://getgram.ai) as a solution to this. Gram is a platform that lets you create, curate, and host MCP servers for your API.

## A quick recap of MCP Servers and how people use them

The main way that agents use API is through [MCP](http://speakeasy.com/mcp). MCP has seen an unprecedented rate of adoption. It was announced by Anthropic in November 2024, and within a few months it had been adopted as the defacto standard. Companies like Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Cloudflare and many others embraced it, and offered MCP servers as a new way to interact with their existing APIs.

But creating, deploying, hosting, and managing MCP servers remains confusing and challenging. Although MCP follows a familiar client-server model, it creates confusion about who should build, own, manage, and maintain the server. With APIs, it's always been clear. The producer (like Stripe) hosts the API and the consumer (for example an online shop) uses that API. When it comes to MCP, there are many options, with developers often 'hosting' MCP servers on their own machines, or a company hosting the MCP server for a third-party integration internally for all of its developers to use.

We think that companies will naturally gravitate to hosting and managing their own MCP servers, and we built Gram to make that easy.

## Local, remote, or managed: comparing models for interacting with MCP

![MCP Server models](/img/blog/the-easiest-way-to-host-mcp-servers/managed-mcp.png)

People use MCP in different ways. We can broadly categorize these into the following three categories:

* **Local** - a developer downloads an MCP server to their developer machine, and configures an MCP client, like Claude Desktop or Cursor, to be able to use the tools provided in that server
* **Remote** - a system administrator downloads an MCP server to a company-accessible server. Anyone at the company can configure their MCP client to interact with a company-accessible tool, via this server.
* **Managed** - the API **producer** hosts and manages the MCP server, allowing any of its customers to configure their MCP clients to connect to the server, and use the API.

At the moment, unintuitively, MCP Servers are usually **local**. This means they are hosted or managed on the **API consumer** side. If you're a developer and you want to interact with your payments platform or project management application through an MCP client, you first download the MCP server, run it locally, and hook it up to your MCP client (for example, Claude Desktop, or Cursor) Then you can chat with your API and say things like "show me all my tasks due tomorrow" or "please send reminders to everyone with invoices due this week". This is often the lowest-friction way to play with MCP, but it comes with many downsides like replicated work (everyone at the company needs to run the same local Docker container or similar) and lack of control (there's no centralized place to monitor and control MCP-related requests).

We think the world will move quickly through **Remote** MCP (everyone at a company sharing one hosted server, but with the API consumer still installing and managing this) and end up on **Managed** MCP servers, where its the **API Producer** that is responsible for not only hosting and managing the MCP Server, but also for enterprise security features like access control, audit logs, and billing.

## Introducing Gram - a platform to create, curate, and distribute tools for AI

We built Gram anticipating this world. 

Specifically, Gram lets you:

- Upload the OpenAPI Document for your API and **generate** a full MCP server.
- **Curate** and customize the dozens or hundreds of tools you get into **Toolsets** - a specific set of tools that are likely to be useful to an agent.
- Instantly **host** that MCP server to let your customers connect their MCP clients to it.

We'll explain this in more detail below, but if you're a "show don't tell" person then head over to [getgram.ai](https://getgram.ai) and try it out.

Still here? Let's look at some of what Gram offers:

- **Instant access:** Users can connect to your MCP server without any local setup, removing friction and allowing tools like Claude or Cursor to work out of the box.
- **Distribution:** You can share your MCP server internally or externally without needing others to run it locally, speeding up onboarding and enabling broader adoption.
- **Monetization potential:** Hosting allows you to turn your MCP logic into a product, offering it as a paid integration or service â€“ especially if it exposes valuable tools or APIs. 
- **Reliability and uptime:** Unlike a local setup that stops when your machine sleeps, a hosted server can stay online 24/7. You have a stable endpoint for your MCP server, ensuring consistent availability for users or agents.
- **Accessibility and team collaboration:** A hosted MCP server can be shared across teams or departments, making it easier to centralize tools and support cross-functional collaboration.
- **Scalability:** Like any production system, a hosted MCP server can be monitored, scaled, and secured, allowing you to handle growing traffic and multiple concurrent users.
- **Scoping**: Maybe your customers want their marketing, sales, and product teams to have access to different tools. Maybe some teams should only have read access to some resources. You can easily create different toolsets customized to specific use cases.

## Creating and hosting an MCP server in three simple steps

Gram takes your OpenAPI document and, in just three steps, generates a fully functional, scoped MCP server, ready to use across environments, teams, and agents.

![Running MCP server with Gram](/img/blog/the-easiest-way-to-host-mcp-servers/gram-ai-hosting.png)

Expose your MCP server as an internal or public service without managing infrastructure, while Gram handles hosting, distribution, and security.

Let's see how easy it is to create an MCP server with Gram.

### Create an MCP server

First, upload an OpenAPI document.

:::tip[NOTE]
The quality of your OpenAPI document directly impacts the quality of your MCP server. Learn about writing better OpenAPI documents in the [OpenAPI hub](https://www.speakeasy.com/openapi).

Next, create a toolset.

A [toolset](https://docs.getgram.ai/concepts/toolsets) is a curated bundle of tools for a specific use case or team. In the Gram interface, you can select which tools to include and which to ignore based on your needs.

Set environment variables.

Click **Environments** in the sidebar, and then **+ New Environment**.

Now you can interact with your MCP server in real time in the Gram Playground.

### Public and authenticated servers

To configure your MCP server as public or authenticated, go to **MCP** in the sidebar and select **MCP Config** for your hosted server.

- A **public server** can be instantly used by any of your customers, simply by copying the configuration provided into an MCP client.

![Gram Public Server](/img/blog/the-easiest-way-to-host-mcp-servers/gram-public-server.png)

- An **authenticated server** requires a Gram API key in the project configuration, making it suitable for internal use cases where access needs to be restricted to authorized users.

### Connect your MCP server to AI agents

In addition to MCP Clients like Claude, your customers can automate interactions with your MCP server using AI agents. The Gram Python and TypeScript SDKs support OpenAI Agents, LangChain, and other function-based tooling, and in Gram you'll find sample code to easily create agents within your existing framework.

Here is an example Python snippet that shows how to integrate your MCP server with LangChain:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from langchain import hub
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from gram_ai.langchain import GramLangchain

key = "<GRAM_API_KEY>"

gram = GramLangchain(api_key=key)

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0,
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

tools = gram.tools(
    project="default",
    toolset="marketing",
    environment="demo-environment",
)

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")

agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=False)

async def main():
    response = await agent_executor.ainvoke({
        "input": "Can you tell me about my tools?"
    })
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In the **Agents** tab in the Playground dashboard, you can build agentic workflows by selecting a language and integration type.
