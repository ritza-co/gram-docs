Gram lets you turn your API into tools that LLMs and agents can leverage. In addition to that, you can tap into a growing ecosystem of third-party tools that Gram manages through integrations. Enabling an integration in your Gram project will add a new set of tools that you combine with your own to solve tougher integration problems. For example, if you use HubSpot as your CRM then you can enable the HubSpot integration and use tools to find information about key accounts and drive a marketing automation agent to message contacts.
