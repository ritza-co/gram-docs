title: Tool variations
description: Prompt-engineer tool names and descriptions for better results
---

It's often the case that the endpoints listed in an OpenAPI document lack effective summaries and descriptions that clearly explain the purpose of each endpoint. When these carry over into tool definitions, LLMs can struggle to understand when or how to call tools and how to interpret the result. Improving a tool's description is a form of prompt engineering that is an essential part of building effective agents.

Tool variations are a feature in Gram that lets you edit tool names and descriptions on the fly in order to improve the overall quality of your tools. Combine this feature with evals library to iterate over your agents and tune your way to a solid set of tools in Gram.
